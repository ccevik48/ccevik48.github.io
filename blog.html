		<p>This is my first blog post! Here, I will post updates about relevant 
		events that may or may not deal with my professional experience. As an 
		introductory post, I will discuss the time my graduation cap was mistaken 
		for an explosive.(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0jCPEDBnq7/">Original Instagram post</a>)
		<a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/digital-fiu-graduation-cap-decoration-mistaken-for-explosive/">(Original WSVN Article and Interview)</a></p>
		<p>I had recently graduated from FIU in Computer Engineering in the Summer 
		of 2019. As a way to decorate my cap, I thought it would be cool and fitting with 
		my major if I did something that showcased some "ability", even though 
		this project was very simple. I wired a <a href="http://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-7-segment-display-tutorial/">seven segment display</a> to an Arduino 
		Uno and programmed it to display between "FIU" and "2019". As I approached 
		security, I was immediately brought to the side and my cap and phone were seized.
		After short interrogation I was let go and continued to walk, but not before my 
		phone was given back; I was told I would be given my cap back, but after graduation, I was 
		told that it was destroyed and given a new cap, most likely due to avoid any sort of risk.
		While I was probably acting a bit naive, I should've seen this coming, 
		though just hours before I was at an engineering induction ceremony and had 
		no complaints whatsoever. Oh well, no one was harmed and everything went back to normal.</p>
		<p>Lesson learned: never bring an Arduino to a public event where people can assume the worst. (fake bomb scare).</p>
